Data::Cleaner is a lightweight, fast framework for writing dataset
cleaners. It has less features than some modules which perform
similar functions, but it's fast, which makes it more suitable for
large datasets. It's also simple, making it easier to get results
quickly.

The Data::Cleaner itself is pure Perl, and so are the datatype
submodules bundled with it, but some of the other available datatype
modules may not be.
